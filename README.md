## Hello, kind stranger 👋😳

### About me

- I'm a teenager who started coding two and a half years ago... 🙄
- ...my first project was a slow running discord bot which didn't even have a good looking help command... 🤔
- ...and now I'm still coding discord bots like [reaction bot🎉](https://top.gg/bot/519287796549156864/) and *[HNS OwO Counter](https://discord.gg/hns)*. 🎈

### Now

- 😅 I'm currently working on discord bots, what else?
- 🧠 I'm currently learning [Python](https://www.python.org/). 🐍

### Current project(s)

- 🐠 recoding Fish n Economy
- 🎉 recoding reaction bot -> sharding
